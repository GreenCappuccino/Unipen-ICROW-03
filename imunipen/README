The *.png images in this directory are
provided as a means of visual inspection
if you do not have the upview or upworks
tools for Unipen files at hand.

The XY coordinates are shown using
a Bresenham line generator and a
smooth-edged brush of width=height=6 pixels.

The images could be used for off-line
cursive recognition. No XML annotation
is present at the moment. The words were
pasted in 6 columns. Each cell has 
a width of 700 and a height of 250 
pixels. Scaling is comparable to 300 dpi.
